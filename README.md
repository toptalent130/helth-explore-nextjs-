## What I have done

1. I have built a simple REST API to consume the JSON data using the Next.js API routes.
2. Built functional components for the views using Next.js and TailwindCSS. 
3. Created a sorting function for sorting by multiple options plus searchbox input.
4. Ensured the code can work with unstable internet connection by establishing CSR plus SSR. (SEO friendly)
5. Implemented unit tests for API at the server-side.
6. Pushed the code into my Github account and made it public.
7. Deployed the test program on Heroku server for review.

## Ideas for Improvement
- The filter options other than location could be put into a combobox to ensure better performance and reliability.
- Instead of displaying a modal when clicking on "show more" in the department section of the left part of the screen, additional data could be displayed in the section to ensure better readability.
